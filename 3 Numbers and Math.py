#What is the order of operations?
#In the United States, we use an acronym called PEMDAS which
#stands for Parentheses Exponents Multiplication Division Addition Subtraction. That’s the order
#Python follows as well. The mistake people make with PEMDAS is to think this is a strict order,
#as in “Do P, then E, then M, then D, then A, then S.” The actual order is you do the multiplication
#and division (M&D) in one step, from left to right, and then you do the addition and subtraction
#in one step from left to right. So, you could rewrite PEMDAS as PE(M&D)(A&S).
